HOW TO ADD AN ENEMY TYPE:

* Create a prefab variant from EnemyMain prefab
* Add a sprite to the SpriteRenderer component of the prefab variant
* Adjust the CapsuleCollider
* Adjust moveSpeed, detectSpeed and attackRange from the prefab variant's EnemyMovement script component
* Duplicate an existing enemy's AnimatorController and rename it
* Replace the Enemy_Idle, Enemy_Run and Enemy_Attack animations with new ones (Do not delete them. Instead rename them and change animation in the Motion component)
* Create the following events inside the Enemy_Attack animation:
	- ActivateHitbox
	- DeactivateHitbox
	- IsNotAttacking (at the end of the animation)
* Adjust the child Hitbox
